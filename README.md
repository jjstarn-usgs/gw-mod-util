Utilities to support the mapping of groundwater age

These utilities

* support creation of raster images from finite difference model grids, chaning from model row/column coordinates to real world coordinate systems.
* reading MODPATH particle endpoint files and fitting various age disitrbutions to particle ages.
* creating particle input files with particle placement in proportion to cell volume or cell flux; also handles transient particle placement.
